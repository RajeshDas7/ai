    "Advantages of Artificial Neural Networks ( ANN)\n",
    "► Storing information on the entire network : Information such as in traditional programming is stored on the entire network, not on a database. The disappearance of a few pieces of information in one place does not prevent the network from functioning. \n",
    "\n",
    "► Ability to work with incomplete knowledge :  After ANN training, the data may produce output even with incomplete information. The loss of performance here depends on the importance of the missing information. \n",
    "\n",
    "► Having fault tolerance:  Corruption of one or more cells of ANN does not prevent it from generating output. This feature makes the networks fault tolerant. \n",
    "\n",
    "► Having a distributed memory: In order for ANN to be able to learn, it is necessary to determine the examples and to teach the network according to the desired output by showing these examples to the network. The network's success is directly proportional to the selected instances, and if the event can not be shown to the network in all its aspects, the network can produce false output \n",
    "\n",
    "► Gradual corruption:  A network slows over time and undergoes relative degradation. The network problem does not immediately corrode immediately.\n",
    "\n",
    "► Ability to make machine learning: Artificial neural networks learn events and make decisions by commenting on similar events. \n",
    "\n",
    "► Parallel processing capability:  Artificial neural networks have numerical strength that can perform more than one job at the same time. \n",

    "Disadvantages of Artificial Neural Networks (ANN)\n",
    "► Hardware dependence:  Artificial neural networks require processors with parallel processing power, in accordance with their structure. For this reason, the realization of the equipment is dependent. \n",
    "\n",
    "► Unexplained behavior of the network: This is the most important problem of ANN. When ANN produces a probing solution, it does not give a clue as to why and how. This reduces trust in the network. \n",
    "\n",
    "► Determination of proper network structure:  There is no specific rule for determining the structure of artificial neural networks. Appropriate network structure is achieved through experience and trial and error. \n",
    "\n",
    "► Difficulty of showing the problem to the network:  ANNs can work with numerical information. Problems have to be translated into numerical values before being introduced to ANN. The display mechanism to be determined here  will directly influence the performance of the network . This depends on the user's ability. \n",
    "\n",
    "► The duration of the network is unknown: The  network is reduced to a certain value of the error on the sample means that the training has been completed. This value does not give us optimum results"
